    "This investigation analyzes a dataset containing player information from Minecraft, an open-world sandbox video game. TThe purpose of this individual project planning stage is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, formulate a research question, conduct exploratory data analysis and visualization, and outline the methods and plan for addressing the proposed question. \n",

    "The dataset used in this project originates from a real-world research initiative conducted by the Probablisitic Learning and AI (PLAI) Group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), led by Professor Frank Wood. The research team designed Minecraft research server to study player behaviour and interactions in a dynamic gaming environment."

    "- The dataset may suffer from sampling bias, as players who voluntarily join a research server could differ in motivation, engagement, or demographics from the general Minecraft player base\n",
